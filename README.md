# GitHub Project Automation+

> ðŸ¤– Automate GitHub Project cards with any webhook event

This action allows you to use any of the [pull_request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull-request-event-pull_request) and [issue](https://help.github.com/en/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows#issues-event-issues) webhook events to automate your project cards. For example when an `issue` is `opened` create a card in the Backlog project, Triage column.

If the `pull_request` or `issue` card already exists it will be moved to the column provided. Otherwise the card will be created in the column.


## Usage

Create a [project](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards) with columns in your repository, user profile or organisation.

Create a new workflow `.yml` file in the `.github/workflows/` directory. In the `.yml`file you have to decide what webhook events going move or create a card in a column. For more detailed explanation of the workflow file, check out the [GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file). See the examples below to get started quickly.


### .github/workflows/opened-issues-triage.yml

Move opened issues into the Triage column of the Backlog project

```yml
name: Move new issues into Triage

on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]

jobs:
  automate-project-columns:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: alex-page/github-project-automation-plus@v0.2.3
        with:
          project: Backlog
          column: Triage
          repo-token: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
```

### .github/workflows/assigned-pulls-todo.yml

Add assigned pull requests into the To Do column of the Backlog project

```yml
name: Move assigned pull requests into To do

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [assigned]

jobs:
  automate-project-columns:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: alex-page/github-project-automation-plus@v0.2.3
        with:
          project: Backlog
          column: To do
          repo-token: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
```

## Workflow options

Change these options in the workflow `.yml` file to meet your GitHub project needs.

| Setting | Description | Values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `on` | When the automation is ran | `issues` `pull_request` |
| `types` | The types of activity that will trigger a workflow run. | `opened`, `assigned` |
| `project` | The name of the project | `Backlog` |
| `column` | The column to create or move the card to | `Triage` |
| `repo-token` | The personal access token | `${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}` |


## Private repositories

In some cases you may want to do add this functionality for a private repository or one you do not have admin rights to. You may get an error like:
```shell
GraphqlError: Resource not accessible by integration
```

When this happens you will need to:
1. Create a [personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)
2. [Create a secret](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets) containing the personal access token, call it `GH_TOKEN`
3. Change the `repo-token` in the workflow `.yml`  to reference your new token name:
```yaml
repo-token: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
```

With certain organisations there may be SAML enforcement. This means you will need to `Enable SSO` when you create the personal access token.
```
GraphqlError: Resource protected by organization SAML enforcement. You must grant your personal token access to this organization
```
